# Counterfeit POC (Mobile App)

This project was built with [Expo](https://expo.io/) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

### Setup

With Node installed, run the following commands in the root of the project:

```
npm install
npm start
``` 

This will start the Expo server on your local machine.  The app can then be tested on a simulator or physical device
by following the instructions on the Expo web UI.
